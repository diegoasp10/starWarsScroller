# Star Wars Scroller

This is a project I did for fun, where I use HTML, CSS and JavaScript, it's about the intro of Star Wars, where a little summary is given at the beginning of the movie. With the difference that this time it gives a summary of my professional life.

I had a lot of fun doing it!
